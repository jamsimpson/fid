	<h2>Below are a few words from volunteers who have helped their community through Volumunity:</h2>
	<p>Volumunity made it easy to help out around my community. Through them, I found multiple food drives in my area to help and, in the process, met many amazing people.</p>

	<p>With Volumunity, I was able to easily find volunteer events and sign up with no problems whatsoever. I was also able to join and set up a few book clubs in an effort to encourage people to read more.</p>

	<p>As a freelance writer, I was looking for more writing opportunities and that's when I found Volumunity. I discovered many organizations looking for writing volunteers. Through them, I gained more experience and confidence in my writing as well as helped my community.</p>
